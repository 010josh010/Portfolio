           <img src = "assets/images/akasaka_ryunosuke.png" id="profile" alt="profile"> 
           <p>I'm a hobbyist programmer and electronics wiz.I joined the US Army after highschool as a 25B IT specialist and served for 5 years. My current role is IT support at underwriters laboratories. I am also working towards a computer science associates degree at Durham-Tech and plan to transfer to NCSU. As for projects I am currently working on an anime visual novel game using the renpy engine, and a working door unlocking system using a raspberry pi 2, nginx webserver,  and a servo motor.</p>
           
           <p>Although I have had a love for computers ever since I was introduced to one. It was only around one year ago, that I realized that I was a developer. After going through some difficult times adjusting to life after deciding to leave the army, I ended up moving down to Durham ,NC along with my younger brother. While working full-time in IT , going to school, and care-giving for my brother who has MD, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do anymore. It seemed like everything I pursued at that point led to a dead-end. I became depressed. I felt like I needed to try something different but didn't know what that was until I happened upon a promo email from code academy advertising the Angular.js course. I created an account back in 2007 but only completed two execises in javascript using the '.length' library function before i scratched my head and put it aside.</p>
           
           <p>"Build apps with Angular.js" it said. I thought to myself "well, I like apps... sure, why not... lets give this a shot. Well I have been studying javascript ever since then during my off-time, and sometimes during my on-time. I enjoy the challenge that programming brings, and it has really given me an opportunity to utilize my creativity again. Whether its studying a circuit, making music, or even playing a game, it seems that learning programming has tied them all together and is shaping up to be one of the best decisions of my life. </p>
